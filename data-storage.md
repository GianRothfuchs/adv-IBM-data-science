#W2: Scalabe Data Storage
## Data Storage
The most common data storage options are SQL, NoSQL, and ObjectStorage. Each with its own pros and cons.

SQL Database
| Pros                        | Cons                                |
|:---------------------------:|:-----------------------------------:|
| Well known and established  | Cannot handle well changing schemas |
| High integrity              | hard to scale                       |
| High data normalization     | High storage cost                   |
| Fast indexed access         |                  					|
| Open standard               |                  					|

NoSQL Database
| Pros               | Cons                  |
|:------------------:|:---------------------:|
| Dynamic schema     | No data normalization |
| Low storage cost   | No data integrity     |
| Linear scalability | High storage cost     |
|          			 | Less established      |
|           	     | slower than SQL       |
